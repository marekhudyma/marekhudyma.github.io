* Plant UML

# Introduction
In software development it is important to draw your ideas. The fastest way is to take marker and draw it by hand. Unfortunately it is not permanent unless you take photo and insert it as part of documentation. Unfortunately it doesn't look profesional and it is not possible to modify such drawing.

Another step that I made is to draw diagrams in draw.io. I found it pretty nice: flexible and fast. You can export drawing to the `PNG` file use it. 
Problem comes when somebody else wants to modify it. They need to have an access to the drawings. 
In worst case somebody need to redraw it, or what is most common, will never update diagram. 

## Plant UML 
I like Plant UML because you define **diagram as a code**. 
It has very nice implications: 
* it can be stored in GIT with versioning, 
* if you attach link to drawing, somebody else can modify it in the future. So your documentation can have updated diagrams. 

# Fist example 
As a first example I will demonstrate `sequence diagram`. It need to start from tag `@startuml` and end with `@enduml`.
In between we define a simple diagram, that can we seen below. 
```
@startuml
Alice->Bob : hello
note left: this is a first note

Bob->Alice : ok
note right: this is another note

Bob->Bob : I am thinking
note left
a note
can also be defined
on several lines
end note
@enduml
```

# Style
On the one hand, it is pretty impressive. Small amount of code printed nice diagram.
Unfortunately default yellow style it not something that I like. 
Fortunately there is a way to fix it. You can use styles. There are many of them, that you can search in internet and just use. 
I used two first lines:
```
@startuml
!define LIGHTBLUE
!includeurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drakemor/RedDress-PlantUML/master/style.puml

Alice->Bob : hello
note left: this is a first note

Bob->Alice : ok
note right: this is another note

Bob->Bob : I am thinking
note left
a note
can also be defined
on several lines
end note
@enduml
```
It will produce such a diagram, much nicer.

## OneMinuteRate behaviour

I wrote a very simple application:
* for 30 seconds, every second I call `Meter.mark(100)` and print `oneMinuteRate` value,
* for next 1 hour I just print  `oneMinuteRate` value.


I took the values and drew a diagram.

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/2020-06-01-dropwizard-metrics-misleading-behaviour/oneMinuteRate_100.png" alt="OneMinuteRate for 100 seconds">
</figure>


What I saw surprised me:
* metrics didn't react for 4 seconds after start,
* metrics didn't react for 4 seconds after stop,
* after 1 minute after stop, value of the metric was not zero, but was just decreasing,
* it stopped at value 100 (writes per second were occurring at a rate of 100 writes per second).

Let's see how the diagram looks **after 1 hour**:

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/2020-06-01-dropwizard-metrics-misleading-behaviour/oneMinuteRate_3600.png" alt="OneMinuteRate for 1 hour">
</figure>

From the picture, we can see, that *oneMinuteRate* doesn't go to zero immediately, but exponentially.
After 1 hour, oneMinuteRate achieves value **4,495742528561689E-25**. After 1 hour it is still **not zero**.

## Possible consequences
Imagine that you think that oneMinuteRate behaves in an intuitive way and you set a monitoring alarm to react on value zero or something close to zero.
The alarm would happen with a big delay or will not happen at all. In real time business applications it can cause a big revenue loss.

## Explanation
Of course Dropwizard metrics is a well documented project and we can dive deeper into documentation.

Internally, histograms use reservoirs to store a period of metric data upon which standard statistical information and percentiles are calculated.
By default, a histogram uses an **exponentially decaying reservoir** (EDR).
In [documentation](https://metrics.dropwizard.io/3.2.3/manual/core.html#exponentially-decaying-reservoirs) we can read:

> A histogram with an exponentially decaying reservoir produces quantiles which are representative of (roughly) the last five minutes of data. It does so by using a forward-decaying priority reservoir with an exponential weighting towards newer data. Unlike the uniform reservoir, an exponentially decaying reservoir represents recent data, allowing you to know very quickly if the distribution of the data has changed.

It doesn't sound very bad, but there are several potential implications:
* EDRs are lossy by design; they don’t store every sample (they’re statistically representative).
* EDRs, by default, store a static 1028 samples and samples are weighted towards the past 5 minutes.
* The rate at which samples decay within EDRs is influenced by how frequently the histogram is updated.

## Possible solutions
* In January 2019, Dropwizard 3.2.3 introduced SlidingTimeWindowArrayReservoir / SlidingTimeWindowMovingAverages  - a sliding window-based, lossless reservoir implementation with no loss of precision.
* Calculation of rates on the server side sounds interesting. It simplifies monitoring and looks quite intuitive.
But the second solution could be moving the calculation of rates to the client side. Then you can also move to a different metric library like [Micrometer](https://micrometer.io)

## Dropwizard solution with SlidingTimeWindowMovingAverages
```
import com.codahale.metrics.Meter;

public static void main(string args) throws InterruptedException {
    SlidingTimeWindowMovingAverages averages = new SlidingTimeWindowMovingAverages();
    Meter meter = new Meter(averages);

    // write and print for 30 seconds
    for(int i=0; i<30; i++) {
      meter.mark(100);
      Thread.sleep(1_000);
      System.out.println(meter.getOneMinuteRate());
    }

    // print for 1 hour
    for(int i=0; i<3_600; i++) {
      Thread.sleep(1_000);
      System.out.println(meter.getOneMinuteRate());
    }
  }
```
The result of execution, you can see below:

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/2020-06-01-dropwizard-metrics-misleading-behaviour/oneMinuteRateSlidingWindow.png" alt="OneMinuteRate with SlidingTimeWindow">
</figure>

What we can see is:
* it reacts immediately after start,
* it goes to level `3000` - sum of values of events: 30 * 100,
* 60 seconds after calling it, it goes back to zero.

# Summary
For me, it was pretty surprising behaviour. I know it was well-documented, but for many developers it could also be surprising.
I am pretty sure you want to have a monitoring system that react on spikes / drops in important KPIs in real time.
In general, I think the Dropwizard library was a great library some years ago. Also, the assumption of calculating metrics on the server side can look attractive.
Nowadays, I think it is time to change this assumption.

## Overview 


## Styles 
About style it is difficult to discuss, because everybody has a different one. 
Unfortunately I need to admit, I do not like the default style of PlantUML. It looks pretty old. 



## Integrations

### Webpage

### IntelliJ

IntelliJ, Atom, XCode 


Graphviz
If you want to use class diagrams, you need to install Graphviz. This is a secondary tool that will allow plantUML to come up with placement for different classes and how they should be arranged. 


Free tool 
IntelliJ can generate class diagrams
