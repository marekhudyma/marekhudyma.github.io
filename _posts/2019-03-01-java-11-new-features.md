In this article we will follow the most important new features of Java 11.
Java 11 has been release in September 2018 as Long Term Support version.
Oracle JDK was the first version that cannot be used for free commercially.

# Syntax features

## String methods
New methods has been added to String:
* `isBlank` - true if the string is empty or contains only white space codepoints, otherwise false,
* `lines` - returns a stream of lines extracted from this string, separated by line terminators,
* `strip` - returns a string whose value is this string, with all leading and trailing white space removed,
* `stripLeading` - returns a string whose value is this string, with all leading white space removed,
* `stripTrailing` - returns a string whose value is this string, with all trailing white space removed,
* `repeat` - returns a string whose value is the concatenation of this string repeated `count` times.

## [JEP 327: Unicode 10](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/327)
Java 11 suports the lastest version of Unicode 10. From now you can use emoji in your code.

```java
    System.out.println("ðŸ˜ƒ");
    System.out.println("\uD83D\uDE80");   // alternative way of displaying emoji
```

## New File Methods
Class `java.nio.file.Files` has two methods:
* `Files.readString(Path path)`,
* `Files.writeString(Path path)`

## Collection.toArray

An interface `Collection` has a new method `toArray(IntFunction)`
This makes it easier to create an array of the right type from a collection:

```java
List<Integer> myList = List.of(1, 2, 3);
Integer[] array = myList.toArray(Integer[]::new);
```

## Stream Predicate NOT 
A new `stream` predicate `not` has been introduced, example:

```java
List<String> listWithoutEmpty = listOfString.stream()
        .filter(not(String::isEmpty))
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

## [JEP 323: Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/323)
Java stream got another nice feature: possibility to use `var` in lambda functions, example. 
It is important, because now we can also add an annotation to the variable without specifying variable type. 

```java
import org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull;
...
List<String> fileNames = List.of("").stream()
    .map((@NotNull var text) -> text + ".txt")
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

# [JEP 321: HTTP Client](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/321)
Standardize the incubated HTTP Client API introduced in JDK 9, via [JEP 110](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/110), and updated in JDK 10.
From Java 11 it became a standard feature. Worth to mention: it can execute `asynchronous` calls. 
Example of usage: 

```java
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
        .uri(URI.create("https://www.zalando.de"))
        .GET() // default
        .build();

var response = httpClient.send(request, BodyHandlers.ofString());
System.out.println("status code: " + response.statusCode());
System.out.println("headers: " + response.headers());
System.out.println("body: " + response.body());
```

[JEP 181: Nest-Based Access Control](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/181)
java.lang.Class got a few new methods: `isNestmateOf`, `getNestHost`, `getNestMembers`.
Let's follow the example: first we have `Outer` and `Inner` classes. 

```java
public class Outer {
  
  class Inner {

  }
}
```
Here we can see the behaviour. 
```java
assertThat(Outer.class.isNestmateOf(Inner.class)).isTrue();
assertThat(Inner.class.getNestHost()).isEqualTo(Outer.class);
assertThat(Outer.class.getNestMembers())
    .isEqualTo(new Class[] {Outer.class, Inner.class});
```

It simplifies the access model between `Outer` and `Inner` classes, even for refection (that was not possible before).

## [JEP 330: Launch Single-File Source-Code Programs](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/330)
You do not need to compile single file programs. Instead of compiling and running:
```java
$ javac HelloWorld.java
$ java HelloWorld
Hello World!
```
You can directly run it with `java` command: 
```java
$ java HelloWorld.java
Hello World!
```


# Performance 

## [JEP 315: Improve Aarch64 Intrinsics](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/315)
Optimized: 
* string,
* array intrinsics, 
* maths: `Math.sin()`, `Math.cos()` and `Match.log()` on [Arm64 architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture)

## [JEP 318: Epsilon: A No-Op Garbage Collector (Experimental)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/318)
In java 11 a new `Epsilon Garbage Collector` was added. It allocated memory but does not actually collect any garbage.
It can be useful in case of: 
* Performance testing
* Extremely short-lived jobs.
It stops virtual machine when memory is exhausted.
  
In order to enable it, use flag:
```java
-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseEpsilonGC
```

## Flight Recorder

`Java Flight Recorder` (`JFR`) was a commercial product in Oracle JDK, now it is open source in OpenJDK 11. 
JFR is a profiling tool for Java application. 
You can run profiling for a given application by running command:
dumps the recorded data into a `.jfr` file.
```java
java -XX:StartFlightRecording=duration=60s,settings=profile,filename=helloWorld.jfr HelloWorld
```
as a result it will produce file: `helloWorld.jfr`, that you can analyze and visualize with `Java Mission Control (JMC)``

# Cleanups - [JEP 320: Remove the Java EE and CORBA Modules](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/320)

Removed packages:

* `java.xml.ws` (JAX-WS)
* `java.xml.bind` (JAXB)
* `java.activation` (JAF)
* `java.xml.ws.annotation` (Common Annotations)
* `java.corba` (CORBA)
* `java.transaction` (JTA)
* `java.se.ee` (Aggregator module for the six modules above)

Removed Tools:

* `wsgen` and `wsimport` (from `jdk.xml.ws`)
* `schemagen` and `xjc` (from `jdk.xml.bind`)
* `idlj`, `orbd`, `servertool`, and `tnamesrv` (from `java.corba`)

Deprecated Modules:

* `Nashorn` JavaScript engine, including the JJS tool
* `Pack200` compression scheme for JAR files

# Summary 
In this article we followed changes in Java 11. Personally I find syntax sugar added to String very helpful. I think I will use emoji more often ðŸ˜ƒ
